Being upset and needing to talk it out with at least three different people.
New friends think I'm "too clingy" because I', initiating all of the hangouts.
I'm always blurting out my thoughts on something before they're necessarily fully formed.
People think I'm "needy" when I'm just trying to recharge by connecting with someone.
Being alone makes me feel sad.
I get  energy from being around other people.
Not being busy makes me feel uncomfortable.
